My 16th assignment! This is a fairly simple program that will allow you to create budget categories and then add or remove expenses to/from them.

Instructions:  
1. Create a category via option 1  
2. Edit your newly made category via option 2, then add an expense via option 1  
3. View your expenses via option 3!


Integration of classes and inheritance into my programming is a huge help, since it bundles a lot of the code away with its relevant modules rather than where I am building the logic of the program. It's the same reason I have a running library of my commonly used functions I've made, except that classes are even more convenient for allowing you to call functions on the class when found and trigger the rest of the operation in a neat and secure way.
